### Brief description of the project
We tried to develope a Web application for visualizing and creating statistics using a dataset of accidents in USA from the last 5 years that contains 3 millions records.
We aim for it to feature a registration system for admins that have access to an administration page that allows adding or deleting records, some visualization methods for the data and statistics such as map visualization, 
some charts and a table with relevant information about the accidents and the functionality to export these information.
